<b>The Minesweeper</b> project was a recreation of the classic game with added features and enhancements. It was developed using Pygame for the graphical interface and a custom Tkinter interface for the login system and saving games.

The game included three levels of difficulty to cater to different player skill levels, providing an engaging and challenging experience. The login system allowed users to save their progress and resume their games at a later time.
